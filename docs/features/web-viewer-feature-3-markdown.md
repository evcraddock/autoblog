# Feature 3: Markdown Rendering System

## Overview
Convert markdown content to HTML with syntax highlighting, frontmatter support, and security sanitization.

## Purpose
Create a robust markdown rendering pipeline that transforms blog post content into safe, styled HTML with proper syntax highlighting and consistent formatting.

## Requirements

### Markdown Processing
- Transform markdown content into valid HTML
- Support standard markdown syntax including headers, lists, links, images, and tables
- Handle frontmatter metadata extraction and display
- Provide consistent formatting across all rendered content

### Syntax Highlighting
- Support syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Handle multiple programming languages
- Provide line number support where appropriate
- Support both light and dark theme modes
- Implement language detection with fallbacks

### Content Security
- Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- Whitelist allowed HTML tags and attributes
- Validate image sources and external links
- Filter potentially malicious content

### Image Handling
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Support responsive image sizing
- Validate alt text presence
- Provide fallbacks for broken images
- Optimize image loading performance

### Table Support
- Render tables with responsive styling
- Ensure tables are accessible and properly formatted
- Handle overflow for wide tables

### Link Management
- Open external links safely (in new tab)
- Apply appropriate security attributes
- Maintain internal link functionality

### Performance Requirements
- Render content efficiently for large documents
- Implement caching for rendered content
- Avoid blocking the main thread during rendering
- Support incremental rendering for long posts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Markdown content renders as valid HTML
- Syntax highlighting works for common languages
- HTML content is properly sanitized
- Images load with lazy loading
- Tables are responsive and styled
- Links open safely (external in new tab)
- Code blocks have proper formatting
- Performance is acceptable for large documents

## Security Considerations
- XSS prevention through sanitization
- Content Security Policy compliance
- External resource validation
- Input size limitations
- Error handling for malformed content

## Accessibility Requirements
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation
