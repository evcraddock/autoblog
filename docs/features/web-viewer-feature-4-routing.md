# Feature 4: Routing & Navigation

## Overview
Implement simple hash-based routing for post navigation with browser history support and deep linking capabilities.

## Purpose
Create a lightweight routing system that enables navigation between the post list and individual post views while maintaining URL state and supporting browser back/forward functionality.

## Requirements

### Core Routing Functionality
- Hash-based routing system for client-side navigation
- Support for dynamic route parameters (e.g., post slugs)
- Browser back/forward button functionality
- Deep linking capabilities for direct access to specific posts
- URL state management and updates

### Supported Routes
- Root/Home route for post list display
- Individual post routes with slug parameters
- 404 fallback route for invalid paths
- Route parameter parsing and validation

### Navigation Features
- Programmatic navigation between routes
- Navigation components (home link, back/forward buttons)
- Route guards for validation
- External link handling for social media sharing

### Browser Integration
- Parse initial URL on application load
- Handle external links to specific posts
- Maintain URL state across page reloads
- Support for social media sharing URLs

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hash-based routing works for all defined routes
- Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- Deep linking to specific posts works
- URL updates reflect current page state
- Route parameters are parsed correctly
- Navigation components work as expected
- 404 handling for invalid routes
- Programmatic navigation works

## Technical Constraints
- Modern browsers with History API support
- Fallback support for older browsers
- Mobile browser compatibility

## URL Structure
- Root/Home: `/#/`
- Individual post: `/#/post/[slug]`
- 404 fallback: `/#/404`

## Quality Requirements

### Performance
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Fast route transitions
- Memory leak prevention
- Lazy loading support for route components

### Accessibility
- Proper focus management on route changes
- Screen reader announcements for navigation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Skip links for main content

### SEO
- Meta tag updates for each route
- Open Graph tags for post sharing
- Canonical URL management
- Sitemap generation support

### Error Handling
- Invalid route handling
- Network failure during navigation
- Malformed URL parameters
- Graceful degradation

## Dependencies
- react-router-dom@^6.0.0 (latest version)
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
