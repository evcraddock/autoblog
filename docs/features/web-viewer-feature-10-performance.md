# Feature 10: Performance Optimizations

## Overview
Optimize application performance for large post collections, mobile devices, and slow network connections.

## Purpose
Ensure the web viewer remains fast and responsive across all use cases, with optimized loading, rendering, and memory usage.

## Requirements

### React Performance Optimizations
- Implement memoization utilities for expensive calculations
- Add debounced search functionality to prevent excessive API calls
- Create virtual scrolling capabilities for large datasets
- Optimize component re-renders through proper memoization

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Set up route-based code splitting
- Create suspense boundaries with appropriate fallbacks
- Optimize component loading strategies

### Virtual Scrolling
- Implement virtual scrolling for large post lists
- Support configurable item heights and overscan
- Provide smooth scrolling experience
- Handle dynamic content sizing

### Image Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Support placeholder images during loading
- Handle loading states and error conditions
- Optimize image delivery based on viewport

### Bundle Optimization
- Configure build tool optimizations
- Implement manual chunk splitting for vendors
- Set up bundle analysis and visualization
- Optimize dependency inclusion/exclusion

### Memory Management
- Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed data
- Provide memory usage monitoring
- Handle memory cleanup for long-running sessions
- Optimize garbage collection patterns

### Performance Monitoring
- Track navigation and resource loading metrics
- Monitor user timing and layout shifts
- Collect performance metrics for analysis
- Implement Core Web Vitals tracking

### Progressive Loading
- Implement progressive content loading based on priority
- Use intersection observer for viewport-based loading
- Provide configurable loading thresholds
- Support priority-based loading strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- Virtual scrolling works for large post lists
- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- Image lazy loading improves page load times
- Memory usage remains stable during long sessions
- Performance metrics are tracked and available
- Bundle size is optimized and analyzed
- React components are properly memoized
- Search functionality is debounced

## Performance Targets
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
