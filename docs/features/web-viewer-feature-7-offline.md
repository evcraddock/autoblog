# Feature 7: Connection Status & Service Worker

## Overview
Provide user interface indicators for connection status and implement service worker for static asset caching.

## Purpose
Enhance user experience by showing connection status and ensuring static assets are available offline, while leveraging Automerge's built-in offline data capabilities.

## Requirements

### Connection Status Indicators
- Display online/offline status in the user interface
- Show visual indicators when Automerge sync is active
- Provide feedback when connection is restored after being offline
- Indicate when content is being served from local Automerge storage

### Service Worker for Static Assets
- Register and install service worker for static resource caching
- Cache HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets
- Implement cache-first strategy for static assets
- Handle fetch events with cache fallback for static resources

### User Experience Enhancements
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Clear messaging about offline capabilities
- Smooth transitions between online and offline states

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection status is displayed in the UI
- [ ] Service worker caches static assets
- [ ] Application works offline for previously loaded content
- [ ] Users understand when they are offline vs online
- [ ] Static assets load from cache when offline

## Dependencies
- Service Worker (native browser API)
- Navigator.onLine API for connection detection
- Automerge repository connection status (from Feature 2)

## Notes
This feature complements Automerge's built-in offline capabilities by:
- Adding UI indicators for connection status
- Caching static assets via service worker
- Automerge already handles data storage, sync, and offline-first functionality
