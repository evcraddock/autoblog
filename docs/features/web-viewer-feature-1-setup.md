# Feature 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Overview
Establish the foundational project structure, tooling, and development environment for the Autoblog Web Viewer application.

## Purpose
Create a modern, maintainable development setup that ensures code quality, type safety, and efficient build processes while establishing the architectural foundation for all subsequent features.

## Requirements

### Project Structure
The project must establish a clear, scalable directory structure that separates concerns and supports future feature development:

- **Source Organization**: Separate directories for components, utilities, styles, and type definitions
- **Configuration Files**: Centralized configuration for build tools, linting, formatting, and testing
- **Development Tools**: Integrated toolchain for development, testing, and code quality enforcement
- **Asset Management**: Proper organization for static assets and styling resources

### Technology Stack
The project must use modern web development technologies that provide:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Build Tool**: Modern build system for fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Utility-first CSS framework with dark mode support
- **Testing**: Testing framework for unit and integration testing

### Core Dependencies
The application must integrate essential libraries for core functionality:

- **CRDT Synchronization**: Automerge with Automerge Repo for document management
- **Content Rendering**: Markdown processing with syntax highlighting support
- **UI Components**: Icon library and utility packages for enhanced user experience
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all dependencies

### Code Quality Tools
The project must enforce consistent code quality through automated tooling:

- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript and React-specific rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type coverage
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks that prevent problematic commits

### Development Environment
The setup must provide an efficient development experience:

- **Hot Reload**: Fast development server with instant feedback on changes
- **Script Management**: Comprehensive package.json scripts for all development tasks
- **IDE Integration**: Configuration for optimal IDE integration and IntelliSense
- **Environment Variables**: Support for different environments and configuration

### Testing Framework
The project must establish a robust testing foundation:

- **Unit Testing**: Component and utility function testing capabilities
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing for critical user paths
- **Coverage Reporting**: Code coverage metrics and reporting tools
- **Test Utilities**: Mock functions and test helpers for complex scenarios

### Build Configuration
The application must support optimized builds for production deployment:

- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree shaking for minimal bundle sizes
- **Asset Processing**: Efficient handling of images, fonts, and other static assets
- **CSS Processing**: CSS compilation with performance optimization
- **Type Checking**: Build-time TypeScript validation and error reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
