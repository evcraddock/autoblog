# Feature 2: Automerge Integration & Data Layer

## Overview
Set up CRDT synchronization with IndexedDB storage and WebSocket networking for the Autoblog Web Viewer.

## Purpose
Implement the core data synchronization layer that connects the web viewer to the Automerge ecosystem, enabling real-time document sync and offline-first functionality.

## Requirements

### Core Integration
- Initialize Automerge repository with IndexedDB storage adapter
- Establish WebSocket connection to sync server for real-time synchronization
- Implement read-only mode to prevent write operations from web viewer
- Generate unique peer ID for each client session

### Data Access Layer
- Create service layer for fetching blog posts and index
- Implement methods to retrieve posts by document ID and slug
- Provide functionality to get all posts and blog index
- Handle document not found scenarios gracefully

### React Integration
- Create React hooks for Automerge state management
- Provide hooks for accessing individual posts and post collections
- Implement context provider for sharing repository instance
- Ensure reactive updates when documents change

### Connection Management
- Track connection status to sync server
- Implement reconnection logic for network failures
- Monitor connection health and sync progress
- Handle sync conflicts and resolution

### Type Definitions
- Define TypeScript interfaces for BlogPost and BlogIndex
- Ensure type compatibility with CLI component
- Include all required fields: title, author, published date, status, slug, description, content, and optional image URL

### Error Handling
- Implement recovery mechanisms for network failures
- Handle invalid or corrupted documents
- Provide graceful degradation when sync is unavailable
- Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automerge repository initializes successfully
- [ ] IndexedDB storage adapter connects and persists data
- [ ] WebSocket client connects to sync server
- [ ] React hooks provide reactive data access
- [ ] Connection status is tracked and exposed
- [ ] Error handling covers network failures
- [ ] Type safety is maintained throughout
- [ ] Read-only mode is enforced (no write operations)

## Dependencies
- @automerge/automerge@^2.0.0
- @automerge/automerge-repo
- @automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb
- @automerge/automerge-repo-network-websocket
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

## Security Considerations
- Read-only document access
- Input validation for document IDs
- Network request sanitization
- Error message sanitization

## Performance Considerations
- Document caching strategies
- Lazy loading for large documents
- Connection pooling optimization
- Memory usage monitoring
