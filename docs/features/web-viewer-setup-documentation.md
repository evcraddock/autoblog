# Feature 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Overview
The foundational project structure, tooling, and development environment for the Autoblog Web Viewer application has been established.

## Purpose
A modern, maintainable development setup has been created that ensures code quality, type safety, and efficient build processes while establishing the architectural foundation for all subsequent features.

## Current Implementation

### Project Structure
The project has established a clear, scalable directory structure that separates concerns and supports future feature development:

- **Source Organization**: Separate directories for components (`src/components/`), utilities (`src/utils/`), styles (`src/styles/`), and type definitions (`src/types/`)
- **Configuration Files**: Centralized configuration for Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest
- **Development Tools**: Integrated toolchain with Vite for development and building
- **Asset Management**: Public directory for static assets and organized styling resources

### Technology Stack
The project uses modern web development technologies with latest major version upgrades:

- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.7.3 for type-safe component development
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0.2 for fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.11 utility-first framework with CSS-first configuration and dark mode support
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 for unit and integration testing with React Testing Library 16.3.0

### Core Dependencies
The application has integrated essential libraries for core functionality:

- **CRDT Synchronization**: Automerge 2.1.10 with Automerge Repo 2.0.7 for document management
- **Content Rendering**: React-markdown 10.1.0 with syntax highlighting via rehype-highlight 7.0.2
- **UI Components**: Lucide-react 0.525.0 for icons and routing via react-router-dom 7.6.3
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all dependencies

### Code Quality Tools
The project enforces consistent code quality through automated tooling:

- **Linting**: ESLint configured with TypeScript and React-specific rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type coverage
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky and lint-staged for automated quality checks

### Development Environment
The setup provides an efficient development experience:

- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with instant feedback on changes
- **Script Management**: Comprehensive package.json scripts for all development tasks
- **IDE Integration**: TypeScript configuration for optimal IDE integration and IntelliSense

## Known Dependencies and Workarounds

### Automerge React Hooks Compatibility ⚠️
The Automerge ecosystem currently has a dependency constraint that requires specific handling:

#### Issue
- **@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks**: v2.1.0 depends on React ^18.0.0
- **@automerge/react**: v2.1.0 also requires React ^18.0.0  
- **Project**: Running React 19.1.0 for latest features and performance

#### Current Workaround
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### Why This Works
- `--legacy-peer-deps` allows npm to install packages despite peer dependency conflicts
- React 19 maintains backward compatibility with React 18 hooks and patterns
- Automerge functionality works correctly despite the version mismatch
- All tests pass and no runtime issues have been observed

#### CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions workflows updated to use `--legacy-peer-deps`:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
  working-directory: autoblog-web
```

#### Future Resolution
- Monitor Automerge ecosystem for React 19 compatibility updates
- Consider contributing React 19 support to the Automerge community
- Evaluate alternative CRDT libraries if compatibility issues arise

### Browser Support Requirements
- **React 19**: Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+
- **Vite 7**: ES2020+ and native ES modules support
