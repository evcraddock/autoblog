# Feature 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Overview
The foundational project structure, tooling, and development environment for the Autoblog Web Viewer application has been established.

## Purpose
A modern, maintainable development setup has been created that ensures code quality, type safety, and efficient build processes while establishing the architectural foundation for all subsequent features.

## Current Implementation

### Project Structure
The project has established a clear, scalable directory structure that separates concerns and supports future feature development:

- **Source Organization**: Separate directories for components (`src/components/`), utilities (`src/utils/`), styles (`src/styles/`), and type definitions (`src/types/`)
- **Configuration Files**: Centralized configuration for Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest
- **Development Tools**: Integrated toolchain with Vite for development and building
- **Asset Management**: Public directory for static assets and organized styling resources

### Technology Stack
The project uses modern web development technologies with latest major version upgrades:

- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.7.3 for type-safe component development
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0.2 for fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 utility-first framework with dark mode support
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 for unit and integration testing with React Testing Library 16.3.0

### Core Dependencies
The application has integrated essential libraries for core functionality:

- **CRDT Synchronization**: Automerge 2.1.10 with Automerge Repo 2.0.7 for document management
- **Content Rendering**: React-markdown 10.1.0 with syntax highlighting via rehype-highlight 7.0.2
- **UI Components**: Lucide-react 0.525.0 for icons and routing via react-router-dom 7.6.3
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all dependencies

### Code Quality Tools
The project enforces consistent code quality through automated tooling:

- **Linting**: ESLint configured with TypeScript and React-specific rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type coverage
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky and lint-staged for automated quality checks

### Development Environment
The setup provides an efficient development experience:

- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with instant feedback on changes
- **Script Management**: Comprehensive package.json scripts for all development tasks
- **IDE Integration**: TypeScript configuration for optimal IDE integration and IntelliSense
- **Environment Variables**: Vite environment variable support for different configurations

### Testing Framework
The project has established a robust testing foundation:

- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Testing**: Testing utilities for complex user interactions
- **Coverage Reporting**: Built-in Vitest coverage reporting capabilities
- **Test Utilities**: Mock functions and test helpers configured in setup files

### Build Configuration
The application supports optimized builds for production deployment:

- **Bundle Optimization**: Vite's automatic code splitting and tree shaking
- **Asset Processing**: Efficient handling of images and static assets via Vite
- **CSS Processing**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS for optimized styling
- **Type Checking**: Build-time TypeScript validation through Vite plugin

## Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade Issue ⚠️

### Current State
- **Status**: Temporarily using Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (stable)
- **Target**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 (blocked by upgrade tool bug)
- **Issue**: Official upgrade tool encounters `flatMap` TypeError

### Attempted Solutions
1. **Manual Migration**: Attempted CSS-first configuration approach
2. **Official Tool**: `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next` fails with JavaScript error
3. **Downgrade Strategy**: Reverted to v3.4.17 for stability

### Upgrade Documentation
- **Official Guide**: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide
- **Key Changes in v4**: CSS-first config, `@import "tailwindcss"`, automatic content detection
- **Breaking Changes**: Complete configuration overhaul, browser support requirements

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Wait for tool fix**: Monitor official Tailwind CSS upgrade tool updates
2. **Manual migration**: Implement v4 CSS configuration manually when tool is fixed
3. **Alternative**: Stay on v3.4.17 until v4.1+ has stable migration path

### Node.js Compatibility ✅
- **Current**: Node.js 22.14.0
- **React 19 Requirement**: Node.js 16+ (fully compatible)
- **Tailwind v4 Requirement**: Modern browser support (Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+)

## Dependencies and Constraints
This feature had no dependencies on other features and has been completed as the foundation for all subsequent development work. The current setup supports all planned features, though a React 19 upgrade will require careful migration of several major dependencies with breaking changes.
