# Feature 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Overview
The foundational project structure, tooling, and development environment for the Autoblog Web Viewer application has been established.

## Purpose
A modern, maintainable development setup has been created that ensures code quality, type safety, and efficient build processes while establishing the architectural foundation for all subsequent features.

## Current Implementation

### Project Structure
The project has established a clear, scalable directory structure that separates concerns and supports future feature development:

- **Source Organization**: Separate directories for components (`src/components/`), utilities (`src/utils/`), styles (`src/styles/`), and type definitions (`src/types/`)
- **Configuration Files**: Centralized configuration for Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest
- **Development Tools**: Integrated toolchain with Vite for development and building
- **Asset Management**: Public directory for static assets and organized styling resources

### Technology Stack
The project uses modern web development technologies:

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first framework with dark mode support
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration testing with React Testing Library

### Core Dependencies
The application has integrated essential libraries for core functionality:

- **CRDT Synchronization**: Automerge 2.2.8 with Automerge Repo 1.2.1 for document management
- **Content Rendering**: React-markdown 9.0.3 with syntax highlighting via react-syntax-highlighter
- **UI Components**: Lucide-react for icons and clsx for utility class management
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all dependencies

### Code Quality Tools
The project enforces consistent code quality through automated tooling:

- **Linting**: ESLint configured with TypeScript and React-specific rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type coverage
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky and lint-staged for automated quality checks

### Development Environment
The setup provides an efficient development experience:

- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with instant feedback on changes
- **Script Management**: Comprehensive package.json scripts for all development tasks
- **IDE Integration**: TypeScript configuration for optimal IDE integration and IntelliSense
- **Environment Variables**: Vite environment variable support for different configurations

### Testing Framework
The project has established a robust testing foundation:

- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Testing**: Testing utilities for complex user interactions
- **Coverage Reporting**: Built-in Vitest coverage reporting capabilities
- **Test Utilities**: Mock functions and test helpers configured in setup files

### Build Configuration
The application supports optimized builds for production deployment:

- **Bundle Optimization**: Vite's automatic code splitting and tree shaking
- **Asset Processing**: Efficient handling of images and static assets via Vite
- **CSS Processing**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS for optimized styling
- **Type Checking**: Build-time TypeScript validation through Vite plugin

## Completed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Project initializes successfully with all required dependencies
- [x] Development server starts and serves the application without errors (via `npm run dev`)
- [x] Production build completes successfully and produces optimized assets (via `npm run build`)
- [x] All linting rules pass without errors or warnings
- [x] Code formatting is consistent across all source files
- [x] Type checking passes with strict TypeScript configuration
- [x] Test framework executes and reports results correctly (via `npm test`)
- [x] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits that fail quality checks

### Technical Requirements

- [x] Prettier ensures uniform code appearance
- [x] TypeScript definitions provide comprehensive type safety
- [x] Pre-commit hooks run relevant checks on staged files only
- [x] All configuration files are properly documented

## System Requirements
- Node.js current LTS version or higher
- npm or package manager
- Modern web browser supporting current ECMAScript standards
- Git version control system
- Code editor with TypeScript support

## Configuration Files
The following configuration files have been created and configured:
- `package.json`: Package manifest with dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration with strict settings
- `vite.config.ts`: Build tool configuration for development and production
- `.eslintrc.json`: Linting configuration with TypeScript and React rules
- `.prettierrc`: Code formatting configuration with consistent style rules
- `vite.config.ts`: Testing framework configuration with Vitest
- `.husky/` and `.lintstagedrc.json`: Pre-commit hook configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Styling framework configuration with custom theme settings

## Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive test coverage for all utility functions
- Integration testing for build and development processes
- End-to-end testing for critical development workflows
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking for build processes
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Documentation Requirements
- Project setup and installation instructions
- Development workflow and contribution guidelines
- Build and deployment process documentation
- Troubleshooting guide for common development issues
- Architecture overview and design decisions

## Dependencies and Constraints
This feature had no dependencies on other features and has been completed as the foundation for all subsequent development work. The setup supports all planned features without requiring major architectural changes.
