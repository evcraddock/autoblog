# Feature 9: Error Handling & Loading States

## Overview
Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states for graceful user experience and effective debugging.

## Purpose
Ensure the application handles all error scenarios gracefully while providing clear feedback to users and maintaining application stability.

## Requirements

### Error Boundary System
- React error boundaries must catch and display errors gracefully
- Error fallback components should provide user-friendly error messages
- Users should be able to retry failed operations or reload the page
- Error details should be available in development mode for debugging

### Global Error Handling
- Global error handler must capture unhandled JavaScript errors
- Unhandled promise rejections must be caught and processed
- Network errors must be handled appropriately with proper categorization
- Error reporting and logging system for monitoring and debugging

### Loading States
- Loading indicators must be shown during all async operations
- Skeleton loaders should provide smooth loading experience for content
- Loading states should be accessible and provide screen reader announcements
- Different loading indicators for different types of operations (small, medium, large)

### Error State Management
- Error states must be properly managed across components
- Retry functionality must work for failed operations
- Loading state hook for managing async operations
- Error persistence for offline scenarios

### Error Categories
The system must handle different types of errors:
- Network errors (connection failures, timeouts)
- Validation errors (invalid input, missing data)
- Authentication errors (unauthorized access)
- Authorization errors (insufficient permissions)
- Not found errors (missing resources)
- Server errors (5xx responses)
- Client errors (4xx responses)
- Unknown/unexpected errors

### User Experience Requirements
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Users should have clear options for recovery (retry, reload, go back)
- Error states should not break the application flow
- Loading states should prevent user confusion during operations

### Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader announcements for error states
- Focus management after errors occur
- Keyboard navigation for error recovery actions
- Clear error messaging with proper color contrast
- Error states that don't rely solely on color

### Performance Requirements
- Error handling should have minimal impact on normal operations
- Error details should be lazy-loaded when needed
- Error reporting should be debounced to prevent spam
- Memory leak prevention in error state management
